                                Every cricket game starts with a toss of a coin. The winner of the toss gets to decide whether they want to bat or bowl first.

                            <li>
                                While the decision to bat or bowl first may seem trivial, it can have a huge impact on the outcome of the match, giving an advantage to the team that wins the toss.

                        Depending on the time and the place, teams would prefer to go first or second due to changing weather conditions. For example, chasing becomes easier in cities located in high humidity regions due to dew on the grass playing a factor
                        In the below graph, you can explore the humidity various stadium locations depending on the year.
                        Each circle on the map indicates the city where the stadium is located. The color of the dot indicates the average humidity of all the years. The lighter the blue color the less humid and the darker the more humid.
                        For easy comparison, the rest of the map is colored to be 50% humidity to easily visualize the cities with higher or lower humidity.
