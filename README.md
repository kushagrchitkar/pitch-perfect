# Cricket Analysis
CS171 Final Project, by the Three Cricketeers

We downloaded our data from Kaggle, and used the library fullPage.js for editing our website design, d3.js for our visualizations, and used fonts from Google Fonts.

We took inspiration from the examples of fullPage.js to have video backgrounds, that give the audience a better feel of the game. All of those are stored in the img directory. Further, our data is stored in the data folder.

All of our visualizations are dynamic and hence made as JavaScript files, stored in the js folder.

The stylesheet is in the css folder, and the index.html is the main html file.

This is the link to our final website: https://kushagrchitkar.github.io/pitch-perfect.github.io/ 

This is the link to our presentation video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1neHhINqZc61PQ1OkQ2MaokNpg6ubxGRA/view?usp=sharing

We hope you enjoy this journey that our website takes you on, and appreciate this beautiful game a little more :)

## Additional details:
How to run the code:

## Non obvious features of our code:
